{"name":"EDT Workshop","tagline":"","body":"# Background\r\n\r\nThe aim of YRS x EDT Workshops is to introduce young people to the foundations of digital making and technology in an enjoyable and immersive way. Our workshops are inspirational, fun and hands-on, with a focus on peer-to-peer learning and teamwork. Each workshop follows a simple, three module process that introduces the basics before quickly allowing participants to explore the practical application of their new skills. \r\n\r\nThe YRS x EDT Introduction to Web Development Workshop provides the fundamental development and design skills required to build for the web. During this workshop, participants will be introduced to HTML, CSS and Javascript, implementing these skills to customise their own webpage. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Section 1 - Logic\r\n\r\n## Webmaker X-ray Goggles\r\n\r\n[webmaker.org/goggles/install](http://webmaker.org/goggles/install)\r\n\r\n[usepanda.com/app](http://usepanda.com/app)\r\n\r\n# Section 2 - Introduction to Code\r\n\r\n## HTML - Activity\r\n\r\n[Add the missing tags to this document](http://codepen.io/youngrewired/pen/VLgGMP)\r\n\r\n[Hereâ€™s what it should look like!](http://codepen.io/youngrewired/pen/VLBpEo)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
